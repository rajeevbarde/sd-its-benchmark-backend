# No Test Execution Rule

## Important: Never Execute Test Cases from Command Line

**NEVER** run any test cases, test suites, or testing commands from the command line or terminal. This includes but is not limited to:

- `npm test`
- `npm run test`
- `jest`
- `mocha`
- `cypress`
- `playwright test`
- `pytest`
- `unittest`
- Any other testing framework commands

### Why This Rule Exists
- Test execution may interfere with development workflow
- Tests should only be run in controlled environments
- Prevents accidental test runs that could affect the system
- Maintains development environment stability

### What to Do Instead
- Use IDE-integrated test runners when needed
- Review test code without execution
- Focus on code analysis and development tasks
- If test execution is absolutely necessary, consult with the team first

### Compliance
Always check any proposed terminal commands to ensure they do not include test execution commands before suggesting or running them.
