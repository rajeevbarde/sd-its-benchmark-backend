# User Command Execution Rule

## Important: All Command Line Execution Must Be Done By User

**NEVER** execute any commands automatically. Instead, provide the commands to the user for manual execution.

### Core Principle
- Cursor should **ONLY** provide commands and instructions
- The user must **ALWAYS** execute commands themselves
- This ensures user control and awareness of all system changes

### What Cursor Should Do
- Analyze the task and determine required commands
- Present clear, complete commands to the user
- Explain what each command does
- Provide step-by-step instructions when needed
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

### What Cursor Should NOT Do
- Execute commands automatically using terminal tools
- Run scripts without explicit user approval
- Make system changes without user oversight
- Assume user wants immediate execution

### Command Presentation Format
When providing commands, use this format:
```
**Command to run:**
```bash
your-command-here
```

**What this does:**
[Explanation of what the command will accomplish]

**Next steps:**
[What the user should do after running this command]
```

### Exception Handling
- Only in emergency situations (with clear explanation)
- When explicitly requested by user for automation
- For read-only operations that cannot cause harm

### User Control
- Always ask for user approval before suggesting complex commands
- Provide alternatives when possible
- Explain risks and benefits of each command
- Allow user to modify commands before execution

### Compliance
Before suggesting any command execution, ensure:
1. User understands what the command will do
2. User has the option to modify or reject the command
3. User maintains full control over their system
4. All potential risks are clearly communicated
